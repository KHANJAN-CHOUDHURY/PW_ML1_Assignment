    "Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity. This method performs L2 regularization. When the issue of multicollinearity occurs, least-squares are unbiased, and variances are large, this results in predicted values being far away from the actual values. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-colinearity problem:** Multicollinearity exists whenever an independent variable is highly correlated with one or more of the other independent variables in a multiple regression equation. Multicollinearity is a problem because it will make the statistical inferences less reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression differs from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression in that it adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the sum of squared coefficients. This penalty term shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing their variance and making them more stable and reliable. OLS regression, on the other hand, does not have any penalty term and tries to minimize the sum of squared residuals only. OLS regression can produce unbiased estimates, but they may have large variances and be far from the true values when there is multicollinearity among the independent variables."
